To be 100% honest I thought a lot about what to write here. It’s true that, influenced directly by <a href="https://akitaonrails.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akita</a>, I decided to take the first step in this project, but the main idea had been brewing for a while.

Nice to meet you, I’m Paulo Curvello! I'm a programmer (I won’t say exactly what I do because anyone who works in the field knows you have to be proficient in a little bit of everything) and this is my blog.

The central idea is simple: this will be an organized “dump” of my brain. Everything I’m seeing, studying, and experimenting with will be turned into posts that I believe will be useful in professional and personal life, in other words, I want to create a personal reference library.

Yes, I know the tech world changes fast. Even if some posts become obsolete, the idea is to go back and supplement/update older topics without losing focus.

I believe your participation is fundamental in this: criticism, opinions, ideas, and suggestions will always be very welcome, after all, you’re reading this far for a reason.

Without further ado, the journey starts now!

Feel free to explore the first articles and tell me what you think.

**Welcome to my blog.**
